# Thermal Imaging Sensor with MLX90640

#### Project Overview

This project utilizes the MLX90640 thermal imaging sensor to capture temperature data from its field of view. The Arduino Uno communicates with the MLX90640 sensor over I2C to receive temperature readings, which are then printed to the serial monitor.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Uno**
2. **MLX90640 Thermal Imaging Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**
4. **Computer with Serial Monitor**

### Block Diagram



#### Pin Connections

- **MLX90640 Sensor:**
  - SDA: Connect to Arduino Uno's SDA pin (Analog pin A4)
  - SCL: Connect to Arduino Uno's SCL pin (Analog pin A5)
  - VCC: Connect to Arduino 3.3V or 5V (check sensor specifications)
  - GND: Connect to Arduino GND

#### Instructions

1. **Set Up the Circuit:**
   - Connect the SDA pin of the MLX90640 sensor to the SDA pin (A4) of the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the SCL pin of the sensor to the SCL pin (A5) of the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the VCC and GND pins of the sensor to the appropriate power and ground pins on the Arduino.

2. **Initialize the System:**
   - Begin serial communication at a baud rate of 9600 in the setup function.
   - Initialize the Wire library for I2C communication.

3. **Configure MLX90640 Sensor:**
   - Initialize the MLX90640 sensor using `mlx.begin(MLX90640_ADDR)`.
   - Set the refresh rate of the sensor using `mlx.setRefreshRate()` (default is 2 Hz).

4. **Read and Display Temperature Data:**
   - In the loop function, continuously get new data from the MLX90640 sensor using `mlx.getFrame(frame)`.
   - Calculate object temperatures using `mlx.temperatureToSerial(frame, TA_SHIFT)`.
   - The temperature readings are printed to the serial monitor.

#### Applications

- **Thermal Imaging:** Use the MLX90640 sensor for thermal imaging applications to detect temperature variations.
- **Industrial Monitoring:** Monitor temperature in industrial environments to detect anomalies or overheating.
- **Research and Development:** Utilize thermal imaging for research purposes in various fields such as medicine, agriculture, and engineering.

#### Notes

- Ensure proper power supply and ground connections for reliable communication with the MLX90640 sensor.
- Adjust the refresh rate according to the application requirements.
